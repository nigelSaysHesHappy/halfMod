# Every line in this file that does not start with a `#` will be ran when a player joins
# Identifiers are processed before execution, so to run a command as a player, you can use:
#   execute as %me run say I love you guys!
#   hm_rocket %me
# To send an identifier to the command itself or to use a literal `%`, preceed it with another `%`:
#   say 100%% all day
#   execute as %me run say I keep it 100%%
# Since the `hm_rocket` command also processes identifiers, this will target a random player:
#   hm_rocket %%r
# But since the player is lost when the command runs, this can still target the joiner:
#   hm_rocket %%!r
# While this will not:
#   hm_rocket %!r
